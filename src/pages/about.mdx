Snowflake Nordic Ski Center is a non-profit, year-round family recreation center. 
We offer a wide range of outdoor opportunities. 
A daily fee or season membership is your ticket to family fun.

Snowflake was owned and operated by **[George](http://www.skinnyski.com/racing/articles/hovland.html) and Jane Hovland** for over thirty years. 
In 1952, he was an Olympic Nordic Skier. 
George managed the operation on a shoestring budget with humor and good will.
