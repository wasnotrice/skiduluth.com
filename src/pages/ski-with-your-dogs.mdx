#### Dogs

Hi Snowflake Members and Members' Mutts:

The trails are open for walking and skiing for members and their dogs--on or off lead. In order to have this be a good experience, please note the following:

1. You must be a member of Snowflake.
2. You must pick up after your dog(s) and bring your own bag.
3. Please consider the safety of all concerned. Your pet must be under control. You will be held responsible for your petâ€™s behavior while on Snowflake grounds.
4. We do not allow biking on the trails.

Have fun; we know you will do your best to keep Snowflake beautiful!
