KidSki runs Sunday, January 12th – February 16th from 2:00-3:00 pm

For over 28 years, KidSki has been getting kids on skis and developing the basic skills which make Nordic skiing fun.
Our volunteer coaches are experienced high school, parent, and community skiers, many of whom began in KidSki.
All coaches follow the time-tested KidSki lesson plans, which make getting outside in the winter fun!
The goal is to make lessons safe, exciting, and to give each participant a sense of improvement and accomplishment each week.
Beginning skiers will learn the classic (stride/traditional) ski technique.
Older kids with previous classic ski experience may sign up for the skate technique lessons.
Snowflake KidSki is open to ages 4-16.
Kids will be placed in groups based upon age and sub-divided in those groups by experience.

Snowflake KidSki 2025 will run Sunday, January 12th to February 16th from [2:00 – 3:30*](#penguin) p.m. at Snowflake Nordic Ski Center on Rice Lake Road.

<Note type="note" marker="*" id="penguin">The Penguin Group, our youngest age group (age 4/pre-K), runs from 2:00-3:00 p.m. Please note, a Penguin skier’s parent/caregiver must be on-snow with their skier during class.</Note>

<Note type="info" marker="*" id="security-deposit">Security Deposit: An additional $100 check, per pair of skis, payable to Snowflake will be required for participating in the take-home program. This check will only be cashed if the equipment is not returned in working order at the end of KidSki.</Note>
Once you have registered for your ski rental, be on the lookout for an email that will direct you to sign-up for one of our ski fitting opportunities.

For additional questions, please contact Emily Ranta, KidSki Manager, at kidskisnowflake@gmail.com.

_We want to ensure all youth interested in learning to ski have the opportunity to do so. If cost is a barrier to your skier’s participation in KidSki please contact Emily Ranta, Snowflake KidSki Manager, at kidskisnowflake@gmail.com._

### Want to coach KidSki? 
Snowflake KidSki is looking for fun and enthusiastic coaches to help make magic happen this winter! Our skiers especially love their high school and college coaches- they are the coolest! (We also love our adult and grandparent coaches who bring wisdom and knowledge to our groups!)

**Coaches are the most important volunteer position in KidSki.** We have an easy to use curriculum with daily lesson plans for each level. Coaches ages 16+ will be paired with another coach to have fun in the snow with a group of 8-10 skiers. Assistant coaches, ages 12-15, will help ensure kids are having fun and keep the crew together out on the trails.

**Dates, times, and attendance:** Snowflake KidSki runs each Sunday from January 12th through February 16th , from 2:00-3:30 at Snowflake Nordic Ski Center. Coaches are asked to be on-site from 1:40-3:40 each week. While the kids love it when their favorite coach is there every week, we understand you may have to miss a week or two throughout the 6 week session- happy to work with your schedule!

**Interested?** Please fill out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/DUD1oe85xSguU8wv6) so we’re able to reach out with more information.

**Questions?** Please contact Emily Ranta, KidSki Coordinator, at kidskisnowflake@gmail.com or 651-230-2025.

Thanks so much for helping coach the next generation of Nordic skiers!
