## Snowflake KidSki Program 2024!

Sunday, January 7th – February 11th from 2:00-3:00 pm

<Note type="info">Snowflake KidSki is full for the 2024 season! If you are looking for other great youth ski programs in the area please check out [Nordic Spirit Youth Skiing](https://www.duluthxc.com/other-local-programs) or [Duluth XC Ski Club MYSL Ski Sparks](https://www.duluthxc.com/dxcskisparks) programs.</Note>

For over 27 years, KidSki has been getting kids on skis and developing the basic skills which make Nordic skiing fun.
Our volunteer coaches are experienced high school, parent, and community skiers, many of whom began in KidSki.
All coaches follow the time-tested KidSki lesson plans, which make getting outside in the winter fun!
The goal is to make lessons safe, exciting, and to give each participant a sense of improvement and accomplishment each week.
Beginning skiers will learn the classic (stride/traditional) ski technique.
Older kids with previous classic ski experience may sign up for the skate technique lessons.
Snowflake KidSki is open to ages 4-16.
Kids will be placed in groups based upon age and sub-divided in those groups by experience.

Snowflake KidSki 2024 will run Sunday, January 7th to February 11th from [2:00 – 3:30*](#penguin) p.m. at Snowflake Nordic Ski Center on Rice Lake Road.

<Note type="note" marker="*" id="penguin">The Penguin Group, our youngest age group (age 4/pre-K), runs from 2:00-3:00 p.m. Please note, a Penguin skier’s parent/caregiver must be on-snow with their skier during class.</Note>

Please note, rental gear will be handed out on a first-come, first-served basis based on ski fitting time-slots.
Filling out and paying for the rental gear form does not guarantee rental gear availability.
If we are unable to accommodate your skier’s rental needs your rental gear registration will be refunded.
A limited number of take-home rentals will be available on a first-come, first-served basis for an additional fee [(+$30* for members/+$40* for non-members)](#security-deposit), paid for by cash or check at the time of ski fitting.

<Note type="info" marker="*" id="security-deposit">Security Deposit: An additional $100 check, per pair of skis, payable to Snowflake will be required for participating in the take-home program. This check will only be cashed if the equipment is not returned in working order at the end of KidSki.</Note>

Once you have registered for your ski rental, be on the lookout for an email that will direct you to sign-up for one of our ski fitting opportunities.
